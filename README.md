# BIO 322 Project - Gene Prediction

## Authors:

## Project Description

In an experiment on epigenetics and memory, Giulia Santoni (from the lab of Johannes Gr¨aff at
EPFL) measured the gene expression levels in multiple cells of a mouse brain under three different
conditions that we call KAT5, CBP and eGFP. In this challenge, the goal is to predict – as accurately
as possible – for each cell the experimental condition (KAT5, CBP or eGFP) under which it was
measured, given only the gene expression levels.

## Python Environment

```environment.yml ``` -  will create environment file so anyone can run

## Data 

The training data contains the normalized counts for 32285 genes in 5000 different cells together
with the experimental condition under which each cell was measured. The test data contains only
the normalized counts and your task is to predict the experimental condition. You can download
the data here:
